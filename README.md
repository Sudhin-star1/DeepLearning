# 🧠 AI Engineering Portfolio — Core Modeling & Optimization Tasks

This repository contains foundational projects implemented from scratch in **Kaggle Notebooks**, designed to demonstrate deep understanding and practical application of:

- Linear Models & Bayesian Inference  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)  
- Optimization Techniques  
- Neural Network Training (Backpropagation)  
- Algorithmic Fairness & Model Calibration  
- Advanced Optimizers (SGD, Adam, Adagrad)

These tasks were completed as part of a portfolio required for demonstrating hands-on AI engineering skills.
